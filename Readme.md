This was created to excecute small experiments around the matrix completion problem as part of the first project of: **Introduction to Convex Optimization**, given in the fall of 2016 at Universidad de los Andes.

The script uses cvxpy, and we strongly recommend installing it via Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads 

The file *project1.pdf* contains the hand-in paper that was required for the class.
